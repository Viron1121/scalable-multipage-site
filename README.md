# Scalable Multi-Page Site

## Overview
A simple multi-page website demonstrating **clean structure, scalability, and responsive layout**.  
Includes a homepage (`index.html`) and a secondary page (`about.html`).

## How to Run
- **Locally:** Use a local server such as **VS Code Live Server** to view the site.  
  Open the `src/pages/index.html` file using Live Server to see the header, footer, and full layout correctly.  
- **Optional Deployment:** Can be hosted on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

> Note: Header and footer are loaded dynamically using JavaScript. They require a local server or deployment to be visible.

## Adding New Pages
1. Add a new `.html` file in `src/pages/`.  
2. Include shared header and footer from `src/components`.  
3. Update navigation links if needed.  
4. Add page-specific CSS/JS as required.

## Responsive Design
Built mobile-first using CSS flexbox and media queries.
